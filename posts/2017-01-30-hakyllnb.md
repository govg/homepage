title: Hakyll as a notebook
---


Another week gone by, and a lot more time spent on absolutely nothing. 


Projects have started. For BML we'll be studying (stochastic) variational
inference in detail, hopefully culminating in working out the details for
a bayesian model for large scale multi label learning. So far, the only
progress has been on the [video](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Neural-Information-Processing-Systems-Conference/Neural-Information-Processing-Systems-Conference-NIPS-2016/Variational-Inference-Foundations-and-Modern-Methods), which is a
fantastic place to get started.

For OLO, I'm not quite certain what sort of problem we're looking at, but
broadly we'll look to work on non-decomposable performance measures, and
analyzing their regret bounds (either in the stochastic setting or 
adverserial). Material can be found [here](http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/purushot/papers/sgd-tpr-tnr.pdf)
and [here](http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/purushot/papers/nondecomp.pdf)

Thesis work of course, keeps pottering along at a nice pace. We'll be 
finishing Munos' [monograph](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00747575v4/document).
It's made for some dense reading so far, hopefully we get through it.


My most productive bit during the week has been setting up Hakyll for
use as a personal notebook. Now I have a (semi)nice setup where I can simply
fire up vim, edit a markdown file (with random latex/code strewn around) and
have it rendered nicely as a local website. I'll look to hosting it on the
internal homepage the department provides me, but for now it lives on my
disk and on [git](https://github.com/govg/Notebook). 

Setup was quite simple : Simply install hakyll (using your favourite method),
initialize the example, and move around the files / create the directories
you want. For math rendering on the HTML, you might want to take a look at
my site.hs, or google around on the Hakyll forums. In addition, I modified
the generation rules slightly to allow myself a landing page for each course
I'm doing, which includes a high level overview as well as a list of posts
that are relevant to that subject. Maybe I'll refine it as the days go by,
but right now it seems fine and usable.
